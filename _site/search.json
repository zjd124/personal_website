    "text": "Prior Predictive Simulation\nTo complete the Bayesian logistic regression model of Y, we must put prior models on our regression parameters. As usual, since these parameters can take any value in the real line, Normal priors are appropriate for both. We’ll also assume independence among the priors and express our prior understanding of the model baseline beta_o through the centered intercept beta_0c:\nAccording to the research, the expected log(odds) of the coefficient ranges from -0.1 to 1. Thus we set our prior to a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and a standard error of 0.3.\nNext, we will use informative priors for the coefficients of other variables in the dataset. Then we simulated data under a variety of prior models.\n\nset.seed(11)\n\n# plot 100 prior models, look at the prediction on the probability scale\n\ncancer_epred &lt;- cancer %&gt;% \n\n  add_epred_draws(cancer_model_prior, ndraws = 100) \n\ncancer_epred %&gt;%\n\n  ggplot(aes(y = Schiller, x = Smokes)) +\n\n  geom_line(aes(y = .epred, group = .draw), size = 0.1) +\n\n  theme_minimal()\n\ncancer_epred %&gt;%\n\n  ggplot(aes(y = Schiller, x = STDs)) +\n\n  geom_line(aes(y = .epred, group = .draw), size = 0.1) +\n\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# plot the observed proportion of positive results in 100 prior datasets\n\ncancer %&gt;% \n\n  add_predicted_draws(cancer_model_prior, n = 100) %&gt;% \n\n  group_by(.draw) %&gt;% \n\n  summarise(proportion_cancer = mean(.prediction == 1)) %&gt;% \n\n  ggplot(aes(x = proportion_cancer)) +\n\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe plot 100 of these prior plausible relationships as shown above. These adequately reflect our prior understanding that the individuals who smoke or have sexually transmitted diseases have higher probability of getting positive Schiller results than the individuals who do not smoke or have diseases, as well as our prior uncertainty around the rate of this increase. The histogram of the 100 predicted positive result proportions from our 100 prior simulated datasets is displayed. We can observe that the prior predictions tend to be centered around low values. It indicates that our prior tuning is reasonable since we believe that the ratio of getting positive Schiller results should be low. Furthermore, the percent of getting positive results ranged from as low as roughly 0.03 in one dataset to as high as roughly 0.37 in another. This does adequately match our prior understanding and uncertainty about getting positive Schiller results."
